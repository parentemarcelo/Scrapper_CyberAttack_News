# News Titles Scrapper
<p align="justify">
This is a very basic scrapper for searching specific keywords in the titles of news websites.
The goal of this script was to automatize the task of looking for mentions of a company name in a variety of news websites, mainly focused on the possibility of finding publicly disclosed dataleaks or cyberattacks that could be linked to the company.

The [newsscanner_beta.py](newsscanner_beta.py) is working and pre-filled with a list of some websites, however keywords to look for needs to be adjusted for usecase (it's recommended to use a variety of designations that can be linked to the asset of interest).

As a further improvement of this automated OSINT research, another script is under development to expand the search to Telegram groups, since this is also a major place for sharing information on dataleaks.
